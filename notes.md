# engine
- self refference by default in component
- namespaces and modules
- singeltons instead of static classes => only static interface
- camera creating wrapper
- material uniform pipeline
- load textures from gltf
- point lights
- better material pipeline with uniform schema
- usd scene parsing
- rendering backends => webgl & webgpu
- physics worker
- scene skybox
- update terrain lod
- device capibility check and lod (mesh, shader, textures, ...)
- streaming (network and scene)
- scene, sceneNetworkController, remoteClient Component, networkedTransfrom Component
- skinned geometry stats
- heightmap performance and sample interpolation
- firefox fixes and optimizations
- min max from gltf and fallback calculation
- reduce matrix multipications => cache bounding volume data
- namespaces that abstracts initialisation (and entity assemby?)
- acceleraton velocity for third person controller ~ 0.68 m/s^2
- instanced mesh system
- shared physics and movement code from server => go compiled to wasm

# scene service
- server network package verification => block unallowed
- server client authentication => ip based clientId
- server connect with same client id after reload
- client do not send client id in packages => use token
- server append clientId
- game network manager => create local and remote client compoents for entities?
- come up with a dynamic networking model => check o3d engine talk (state, event, ...)
- server abstraction with base architecture that can be shared by scene, com and chat server
